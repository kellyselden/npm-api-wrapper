The GitHub authentication be default points to my test app. If you are deploying to production and want GitHub authentication, either copy the file structure at config/default.json and paste at config/production.json, or set the GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables. You also must set NODE_ENV=production.
